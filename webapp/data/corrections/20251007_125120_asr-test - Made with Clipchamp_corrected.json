  "original": " So for over 300 years Spain occupied the country so it had a big effect on the Filipino culture, language and traditions. Here are some loan words from Spanish. Another country that influenced the galogue is China. There were a lot of immigrants from the Hokkien community who were from the southern tip of China and they immigrated to the Philippines between the 16th and 19th centuries. There are a lot of Chinese influences in the Filipino culture. For example, the cuisine, banset and lumpiat come from the Chinese culture. Also beliefs in feng shui and other things like that come from Chinese culture as well. Here are some Tagalog words that were influenced by China. Hikao, Iring, Susi, Ki, Atte and Guya, so older sister and older brother. Those are some words from the Chinese culture. Next, America influenced the galogue. America occupied the Philippines between 1898 and 1946. And here are some English words that have influenced the galogue. Wais, Wais, Bulpen, Pen, Nars, Nurse, Driver, Driver. Also, Japan influenced the galogue. They occupy the Philippines between 1942 and 1945 and here are some Tagalog words that were influenced by Japanese. Karauke, Catol, which is the incense or some smoke that's used to determine mosquitoes and then tsunami. And again, this is what the Filipino language incorporates. It adds all of these words that have been borrowed from other countries into the galogue, whereas the galogue purists would use other words that were more used in pre-colonial times. Alright, so now let's take a look at where the galogue is spoken throughout the Philippines. There are three main island groups in the Philippines. Luzon, Visayas, in Mindanao. Luzon is up in the north. Then Visayas is in the central area and then Mindanao is way down in the south. The galogue is spoken here in this central Luzon area, so it's more up there in the north. There are so many languages in the Philippines and here are just some of them. Ilocano is spoken up there in the north, northern Luzon area. The galogue again is the central Luzon area. Biculano is in the southern Luzon area. Warai is spoken in the Visayas region, also Cebuano and Visayas. All of that is spoken in the southern areas of the Philippines. And then Heligainon is on the western side of the Visayas region. Now, the big question is what is the difference between language and dialect? I will say that not everyone agrees. Some people think the galogue is a language, some people would say the galogue is just a dialect.",
