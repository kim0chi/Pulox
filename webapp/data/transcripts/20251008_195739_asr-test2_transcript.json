  "text": " moved away, or maybe just for work. There are a lot of overseas Filipino workers, so Filipinos have moved everywhere, all around the world. So Tagalog is spoken in almost every continent. Did you know that there has been a Filipino on Antarctica who did some research there? Other than that, they can be found in South America, Africa, North America, Australia, Europe, Asia, everywhere, really. So it is a very widespread language. In the United States, especially on the West Coast, like California, Nevada, Washington State, Tagalog is one of the most spoken languages in households, according to the U.S. Census. So good for you for learning Tagalog. It is a very useful language when you're meeting someone new. All right, so let's go ahead and learn some common phrases in Tagalog. If you want to say hello, how are you in Tagalog, it's commustaka, commustaka. So it's spelled K-U-M, commustaka. But sometimes you might hear some people say gamustaka, like it's a K-A sound, gamustaka. So if you want to say hello, how are you, it is just one phrase, commustaka. All right, now here are some responses. If you're doing well, you can say, mabuti naman, mabuti naman. That means I'm doing good, I'm doing great, I'm doing well. Mabuti means good, naman is an emphasis word. So I'm doing good, mabuti naman. If you're just doing okay, you can say, ayos lang, ayos lang, ayos means okay, lang means only. So I'm only doing okay, ayos lang. And if you're not doing good, you can say, Hindi mabuti, Hindi means not, mabuti means good. So not good, I'm not doing well, Hindi mabuti. Okay, say these phrases with me one more time. Commustaka, hello, how are you? Commustaka, commustaka, mabuti naman, I'm doing well. Mabuti naman, mabuti naman. Ayos lang, I'm doing okay, ayos lang, ayos lang. Hindi mabuti, I'm not doing well. Hindi mabuti. Hindi mabuti. Next, if you want to ask someone's name, you could say ano ang pangalan mo. Ano means what? Ang means it.",
